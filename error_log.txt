> fix the error
The error message indicates that there's an issue at line 21, column 15 in the file `./pages/index.tsx`. The error message is "Fails". Unfortunately, without more context, it's hard to tell exactly what is failing.

Here's how you can proceed:

1. Open the file `./pages/index.tsx` in your text editor.
2. Go to line 21 and inspect the code around column 15.
3. Check if there are any obvious errors or issues that could be causing the failure. This could be a syntax error, a reference to an undefined variable, a call to a function that doesn't exist, etc.
4. If the error isn't obvious, try adding some logging around this area of code to get more information about what might be going wrong.
5. Run your application again and see if the error persists.

If you're still having trouble, please provide the code around line 21 in `./pages/index.tsx` and I'll be happy to help further!
